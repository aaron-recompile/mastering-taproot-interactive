    "## Why Script Path Changes Everything\n\nWhat if you could build a contract on Bitcoin that looks like a simple payment—until it reveals a puzzle that unlocks funds?\n\nImagine this: you want to create a digital bounty where anyone who solves a puzzle gets rewarded, but if no one solves it, you want to reclaim your funds. Or you're selling digital goods where buyers automatically get unlock keys after payment, but you retain refund control.\n\nTraditional Bitcoin scripts either completely expose all conditions (compromising privacy) or require complex multi-signature setups (inefficient). Worse yet, even simple single-signature payments can be easily identified by their transaction patterns on the blockchain.\n\n**Taproot's Script Path makes all this elegant**: complex conditional contracts look identical to ordinary payments when unspent, revealing only the necessary execution path when needed.\n\nBuilding on the Taproot theoretical foundation established in previous chapters, we'll now dive deep into Script Path spending patterns. This chapter demonstrates how to implement dual-path authorization in Taproot's script tree through a practical conditional payment scenario: supporting both secret-based conditional payments and direct key holder control."
