    "\n",
    "What if you could build a contract on Bitcoin that looks like a simple payment—until it reveals a puzzle that unlocks funds?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine: you want to create a digital bounty where anyone who solves the puzzle gets rewarded, but if no one solves it, you want to reclaim the funds. Or you're selling digital goods where buyers automatically get unlock keys after payment, but you retain refund control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Bitcoin scripts either fully expose all conditions (compromising privacy) or require complex multisig setups (inefficient). Worse, even simple single-sig payments can be easily identified by transaction patterns on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Taproot's Script Path makes this elegant**: Complex conditional contracts look identical to ordinary payments when unspent, revealing only the necessary execution path when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the Taproot theoretical foundation from previous chapters, we now dive into Script Path spending patterns. This chapter demonstrates dual-path authorization in Taproot's script tree through practical conditional payment scenarios: secret-based conditional payments and direct key holder control."

    "- **Alternative path**: Alice, as fund owner, can reclaim funds anytime with her private key\n",
