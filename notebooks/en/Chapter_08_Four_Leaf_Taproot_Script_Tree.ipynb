    "## Introduction: The Leap from Theory to Practice\n\nIn previous chapters, we mastered the fundamental principles of Taproot and the implementation of two-leaf script trees. However, true enterprise-level applications require more complex logic—**four-leaf script trees** represent the mainstream complexity of current Taproot technology in practical applications."
